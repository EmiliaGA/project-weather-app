# Weather App

This is a pair-programming application for week 3 in the Technigo Web Dev Boot Camp - this project is made by Ylva Karlsson and Emilia Granstr√∂m Anundi.

## The problem

We started with the basic structure of the HTML, CSS and the JS-file.
First we added the basic API fetch and got the city to work.
More information to come here...

## View it live

We will add a link to the deployed project here later this week.
